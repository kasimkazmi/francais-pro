### Data Flow

```
User Action → LearningProgressContext → Local Storage → UI Update
     ↓
Achievement Check → XP Update → Level Calculation → Streak Update
```

## 📚 Lesson Structure

### Interactive Lesson Format

Each lesson follows a structured format:

```typescript
interface InteractiveLesson {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: LessonType;
  difficulty: DifficultyLevel;
  estimatedTime: number;
  xpReward: number;
  prerequisites: string[];
  skills: SkillType[];
  steps: LessonStep[];
  activities: ActivityContent[];
  assessment: Assessment;
  reviewSchedule: ReviewItem[];
}
```

### Lesson Steps

1. **Introduction** (30 seconds)
   - Learning objective
   - Key vocabulary preview
   - Context setting

2. **Learning** (3-5 minutes)
   - New content presentation
   - Audio pronunciation
   - Interactive examples
   - Grammar tips

3. **Practice** (2-3 minutes)
   - Hands-on activities
   - Immediate feedback
   - Skill reinforcement

4. **Assessment** (1-2 minutes)
   - Quick quiz (3-5 questions)
   - Skill verification
   - XP and streak update

## 🎮 Gamification System

### XP and Leveling

- **XP Points**: Earned through activities and lessons
- **Level System**: Based on total XP (1000 XP per level)
- **Level Benefits**: Unlock new content and features

### Streak System

- **Daily Streaks**: Maintain learning momentum
- **Streak Rewards**: Bonus XP for consecutive days
- **Streak Recovery**: Grace period for missed days

### Achievement System

```typescript
interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  category: 'streak' | 'xp' | 'lessons' | 'skills' | 'special';
  requirement: {
    type: string;
    value: number;
  };
  unlocked: boolean;
  xpReward: number;
}
```

### Achievement Categories

- **Streak Achievements**: Daily learning consistency
- **XP Achievements**: Total progress milestones
- **Lesson Achievements**: Content completion
- **Skill Achievements**: Mastery in specific areas
- **Special Achievements**: Unique accomplishments

## 🧠 Spaced Repetition System

### Algorithm

The system uses a modified SM-2 algorithm:

```typescript
interface ReviewItem {
  lessonId: string;
  nextReview: Date;
  interval: number; // days
  easeFactor: number;
  repetitions: number;
  lastReviewed: Date;
}
```

### Review Scheduling

- **First Review**: 1 day after completion
- **Second Review**: 6 days after first review
- **Subsequent Reviews**: Interval × Ease Factor
- **Ease Factor**: Adjusts based on performance (1.3 - 3.0)

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Learning Statistics

```typescript
interface LearningStats {
  totalLessonsCompleted: number;
  totalTimeSpent: number;
  averageAccuracy: number;
  currentStreak: number;
  longestStreak: number;
  favoriteSkill: SkillType;
  weakestSkill: SkillType;
  weeklyProgress: WeeklyProgress[];
}
```

### Skill Levels

  const handleLessonComplete = (xpEarned: number) => {
    completeLesson(lesson.id, xpEarned);
    addXP(xpEarned);
  };

  return (
    <InteractiveLessonComponent
      lesson={lesson}
      onComplete={handleLessonComplete}
      onStepComplete={(stepId) => console.log('Step completed:', stepId)}
    />
  );
}
```
