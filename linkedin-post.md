## üöÄ **The Story Behind Fran√ßais Pro: When Friendship Meets Code**

**Two days. That's all it took to change everything.**

My friend was facing a critical situation - his work permit expires in just one year, and his current CRS score wasn't enough for PR. He was planning to take CELPIP again to boost his English score, but I had a different idea:

**"What about French?"**

French language skills can add up to 50 points in Express Entry, with lower score requirements than English. But here's the problem - finding quality French learning resources was a nightmare. Most platforms are expensive, limited, or lack authentic content. It felt like everyone was putting money before helping people achieve their dreams.

**So I built a solution.**

In just 2 days, I created Fran√ßais Pro - a comprehensive, free French learning platform designed specifically for Canadian immigration. But this isn't just another language app. It's a **complete ecosystem** built with cutting-edge technology and a heart for helping others.
